Created with CodeSandbox

8/8/25-8/9/25 experiment

Written completely by ChatGPT, under my guidance/prompting. It works shockingly well.

View it at this link [https://codesandbox.io/p/github/danirui/cayleyGraphVisualizer/main](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/danirui/cayleyGraphVisualizer/main). On the right hand side panel, click `Start 3000` and the Preview should open.

Nodes will have labels (may have to wait a bit before they load/appear), unless you don't want them in which case you can hide them.

The UI is intuitive, self-explanatory. The "physics" engine (jostling, repulsion, springs, etc.) is to evolve the Cayley graph into a nice geometric shape.
